## mod info
this mod's main focus for now is the Summoning Table block, which, 
when combined with the right arrangement of other blocks,
allows you to summon any entity to its location.

### blocks:
* summoning table! the centerpiece of any summoning ritual. used by.. 
  throwing in a true name and building a couple rings of enchanted candles.
  * crafted like an enchanting table, with a true name instead of a book and an amethyst shard and copper ingot instead of diamonds 
  * using a flint and steel on the summoning table while focusing will attempt to activate the summoning
  * using a flint and steel on the summoning table without focusing will burn the true name you placed within
    (assuming you did put one in - you should give it a try!)
* enchanted candles! they're bigger than normal candles and floaty, made to be used in summoning rituals.
  * crafted like normal candles, but with blaze powder instead of string
* smoke wisps, created from burning a true name in a summoning table to help you arrange the candles.
  if you [Focus] (keybind), you'll start to see how it should come together!

### items:
* true name! obtained by right clicking an unnamed name tag on any entity to imprint their true name.
  to be used to figure out the right candle arrangement in a summoning table
* big hat!!!!! any practitioner of witchery needs to at least have the option to put on a big hat.
  * crafted with 4 black wool in the shape you'd figure. 
    get a piece of black wool and you'll get the recipe in your recipe book :)
  * as a bonus, you can sneak up on a few mobs and right-click the hat onto them!
    * (supported critters: cats, endermites, foxes, frogs, parrots, silverfish, and wolves)
    * sneak up on em again with an empty hand to take back the hat - 
      fear not, it'll be just as good as when you gave it to them :)

### summoning!
* if someone sets up a summoning table with *your* true name, you'll receive a summoning request!
  it gives you the info on accepting/rejecting in the request,
  as well as the summoning position and the offerings in the table.
  * focus + jump to accept, focus + sneak to reject

### other:
* your focus keybind defaults to z - there's also a toggle bind available, which is pretty handy.
* nametags can now be used in dispensers! mostly so you can get your own true name, but it works for naming pets too!

if i feel ambitious i might add more magic beyond summoning. maybe magitech if i feel like dabbling in the theme.
this is the plan. come back later and see if we got more magic! or..
