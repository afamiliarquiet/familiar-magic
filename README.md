# familiar magic

### made for [ModFest 1.21](https://modfest.net/1.21)?

---

## mod info
this mod's main focus for now is the Summoning Table block, which, 
when combined with the right arrangement of other blocks,
allows you to summon any entity to its location.

blocks:
* summoning table! the centerpiece of any summoning ritual. used by.. 
  throwing in a true name and building a couple rings of enchanted candles
* enchanted candles! they're bigger than normal candles and floaty, made to be used in summoning rituals.

items:
* true name! obtained by right clicking an unnamed name tag on any entity to imprint their true name.
  to be used to figure out the right candle arrangement in a summoning table
* big hat!!!!! any practitioner of witchery needs to at least have the option to put on a big hat.

## etc.

mrp. i want to be summonable, so this mod must exist :)

if i feel ambitious i might add more magic beyond summoning. maybe magitech if i feel like dabbling in the theme.
this is the plan. come back later and see if we got more magic! or.. 
hang on, i know a thing or two about this time stuff at this fest - are you reading this from the future?
