# familiar magic

### made for [ModFest 1.21](https://modfest.net/1.21)?

---

## mod info
this mod's main focus for now is the Summoning Table block, which, 
when combined with the right arrangement of other blocks,
allows you to summon any entity to its location.

### blocks:
* summoning table! the centerpiece of any summoning ritual. used by.. 
  throwing in a true name and building a couple rings of enchanted candles.
  * using a flint and steel on the summoning table while focusing will attempt to activate the summoning
  * using a flint and steel on the summoning table without focusing will burn the true name you placed within
    (assuming you did put one in - you should give it a try!)
* enchanted candles! they're bigger than normal candles and floaty, made to be used in summoning rituals.
* smoke wisps, created from burning a true name in a summoning table to help you arrange the candles.
  if you [Focus] (keybind), you'll start to see how it should come together! 

### items:
* true name! obtained by right clicking an unnamed name tag on any entity to imprint their true name.
  to be used to figure out the right candle arrangement in a summoning table
* big hat!!!!! any practitioner of witchery needs to at least have the option to put on a big hat.
  * as a bonus, you can sneak up on a few mobs and right-click the hat onto them!
    * (supported critters: cats, foxes, frogs, parrots, silverfish, and wolves)
    * sneak up on em again with an empty hand to take back the hat - 
      fear not, it'll be just as good as when you gave it to them :)

### other:
* your focus keybind defaults to z - there's also a toggle bind available, which is pretty handy.

## etc.

mrp. i want to be summonable, so this mod must exist :)

if i feel ambitious i might add more magic beyond summoning. maybe magitech if i feel like dabbling in the theme.
this is the plan. come back later and see if we got more magic! or.. 
hang on, i know a thing or two about this time stuff at this fest - are you reading this from the future?
